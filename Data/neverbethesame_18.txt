Somethin' must've gone wrong in my brain
Got your chemicals all in my veins
Feelin' all the highs, feel all the pain
Let go of the wheel, it's the bullet lane
Now I'm seein' red, not thinkin' straight
Blurrin' all the lines, you intoxicate me
Just like nicotine, heroin, morphine
Suddenly, I'm a fiend and you're all I need
All I need, yeah you're all I need
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never be the same
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never ever ever be the same
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same
(Never be the same)
Sneaking in L.A. when the lights are low
Off of one touch, I could overdose
You said, "Stop playin' it safe
Boy, I wanna see you lose control"
Just like nicotine, (nicotine) heroin, morphine (morphine)
Suddenly, I'm a fiend and you're all I need (all I need)
All I need, yeah you're all I need
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never be the same
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
(You're to blame)
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never ever ever be the same
I'll never be the same
(Never be the same, girl)
I'll never be the same
(I'll never be the same)
I'll never be the same
(And now)
You're in my blood
You're in my veins
You're in my head
I blame
You're in my blood
You're in my veins
You're in my head
(I'm sayin')
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never be the same
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
(You're to blame)
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never ever ever be the same
