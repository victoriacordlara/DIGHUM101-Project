#### Abstract

This individual project in the field of digital humanities explores the evolution of Latin music lyrics and their impact on popularity over a five-year period from 2018 to 2022. By analyzing the lyrics of Latin songs and their thematic changes, the study aims to identify patterns and adaptations within the genre. The research also examines the relationship between lyrical content and the songs' popularity using data from the Billboard Hot 100 chart positions and Spotify listens. The project utilizes a selection of the first five Latin songs from each year in the Billboard Hot 100 as the dataset. Thematic analysis of the lyrics reveals distinct themes for each year, ranging from relationships and communication to self-expression and desires. The findings suggest a shift in thematic focus, potentially influenced by the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic and changing societal contexts. Additionally, the study examines the average chart positions and Spotify listens per year, providing insights into the popularity of Latin songs and the impact of different themes. Artist performance statistics reveal notable trends among analyzed artists, including Camila Cabello, Bad Bunny, and J Balvin. The project's limitations include time constraints, reliance on the Billboard Hot 100 for song selection, and subjective thematic analysis. However, the research contributes to the understanding of Latin music's cultural significance, identity expression, and its relationship with broader societal narratives. The findings hold implications for artists, producers, marketers, and the broader field of digital humanities, showcasing an innovative approach to studying music and its impact on society.
